# L3CubeCodes

Birthday Paradox Validator

This code calculates the probability by trials and checks it with probability generated by the mathematical formula.
p=1-(364/365)^(n*(n-1)/2)

Tolerance level is 0.002( or 0.2%).

The days are indexed from 1 to 365 for convenience.

Note: Random number generators are used to generate days from 1 to 365. So the probability might turn out to be 1 in all trials.
In that case, the output will not terminate.


Duplicate Files


The code searches for duplicate files and then deletes the duplicate files.

The Random folder used for the output is provided as a zip for testing purposes.



TextFS

STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING TEXTFS FILE SYSTEM - 

1. CREATE A FOLDER TEXTFS

2. SET IT AS CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY

3. NOW WRITE THE SCRIPTS - create, copy, delete, echodata, list

4. SAVE THEM

5. NOW FOR EACH SCRIPT DO THE FOLLOWING - 

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ chmod +x create

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ sudo cp create /usr/bin/

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ chmod +x copy

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ sudo cp copy /usr/bin/

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ chmod +x echodata

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ sudo cp echodata /usr/bin/

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ chmod +x delete

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ sudo cp delete /usr/bin/

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ chmod +x list

biggiep@thenotoriousbiggiep:~/TEXTFS$ sudo cp list /usr/bin/

6. NOW RUN EACH COMMAND AS PER NEED
